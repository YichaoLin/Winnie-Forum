# Winnie-Forum
It is design for discussion. Functions of the website include login, sign in, sign out. After you login, you can see all the question, and you can click a specific one to answer or view all its answer. Also, you can post your own question. Whatâ€™s more, you can search some of the question by key word.
For the website, I use the html and css (bootstrap) to do the front end, Python (flask) to do the backend,  MySql for the database. (other tools include flask-migrate, flask-alchemy, pymysql).
